## Key Features

- **Multi-class Classification** - Recognizes 22 skin conditions including melanoma, eczema, psoriasis, and more
- **Real-time Predictions** - Upload images and get instant probability distributions

## Model

I chose EfficientNet model family. Compared to traditional architectures like ResNet, it utilizes compound scaling, resulting in:
- Lower parameter count
- Higher efficiency
- Higher inference speed
- Reduced overfitting 

---

## Dataset
The model was trained on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pacificrm/skindiseasedataset) consisting of 15,400+ clinical images.
- Data Distribution: The dataset is highly imbalanced (e.g., thousands of Acne samples vs. hundreds of Vasculitis). I mitigated this using WeightedRandomSampler in the training pipeline.
- Preprocessing: Images were resized to 300×300 pixels to match EfficientNet-B3 requirements.
- Augmentation: To improve generalization, I implemented a custom Albumentations pipeline including Flips, Rotate, Affine and ColorJitter (to simulate occlusions like hair or not centered photos).

- Node.js 20+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Docker & Docker Compose (for deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jarzeckil/skin-disease-recognition.git
cd skin-disease-recognition

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync --all-groups

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Pull data and models from DVC
uv run dvc pull
```

### Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
uv run uvicorn src.skin_disease_recognition.serving.app:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Start frontend

## Lessons Learned

I faced several ML engineering challenges:

### Training Challenges

- **Loss Plateau** - Addressed with learning rate scheduling (ReduceLROnPlateau)
- **Transfer Learning** - Learned optimal learning rates for pretrained weights (lower LR for frozen layers)
- **Class Imbalance** - Implemented weighted random sampling to handle uneven class distribution
- **Regularization** - Applied label smoothing (0.1) to improve generalization and prevent overconfident predictions
- **Multi-class Metrics** - Understanding precision/recall/F1 trade-offs in 22-class classification

### Infrastructure & Tooling

- **VRAM Management** - Used gradient accumulation (virtual batches) to train larger models on limited GPU memory
- **MLflow Integration** - Centralized experiment tracking, metric logging, advanced evaluation and model versioning
- **Hydra Configuration** - Structured config management for reproducible experiments
- **DVC Pipelines** - Version control for datasets and model artifacts with DAGsHub remote

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add confidence calibration (temperature scaling)
- [ ] Implement Grad-CAM visualizations for model interpretability
- [ ] Add batch prediction support
